# Jenkins

Jenkins is still one of the most popular automation tool, especially when you are working on multiple projects and you need to have a universal tool that fit most of the requirements which come from the client side.

That's why I'm still using Jenkins and to be honest I absolutely LOVE it!

Here is a pipeline examples and also the JTE engine which Im using for my Jenkins pipelines, feel free to use it and enjoy!

Cheers!
